### Features

- Model intensity channel maps from gas discs using MCMC parameter samplers. 
- Fit intensity and rotation velocity simultaneously. Stellar mass and inclination are no longer degenerate parameters!
- Supports different prescriptions for the disc rotation velocity: Keplerian (2D or 3D) + pressure support + self-gravity.   
- Upper and lower emitting surfaces of your disc can be modelled independently.
- Easy customisation of model parameterisations as a function of the 3D disc coordinates (azimuthal asymmetries are possible!).
- Compatible with input of (irregular) emitting surfaces obtained with the geometrical method of Pinte et al. 2018b.
- Provides tools for the analysis of gas structure and kinematics.
- It has been tested for circumstellar discs but it may be well suited for galactic discs too.


### Mining tools

#### pick

Mine small scale fluctuations in the disc, possibly related to the presence of planets.

#### hammer

Mine larger scale substructure: produce (de-)projected residual maps and illustrations of the gas structure and attributes.

#### rail

Compute azimuthal or radial averages from intensity or kinematical observables.

#### cart

Store model attributes and their default prescriptions.


### Discminer history

Discminer began life as the model.disc2d.py library of [sf3dmodels](https://github.com/andizq/sf3dmodels). This repository is dedicated for versions >1.0 of the code. 

#### v1.0

- Use astropy units wherever possible. All physical parameters provided by the user must be astropy.units instances.
- Creation of several mining tools included in the (1) `pick`, (2) `hammer`, (3) `rail` and (4) `cart` modules to (1) mine small scale fluctuations in the disc, possibly related to the presence of planets; (2) mine larger scale substructure: produce residual maps and illustrations of the gas structure and attributes; (3) compute azimuthal averages from observables; (4) store model attributes and their default prescriptions.
